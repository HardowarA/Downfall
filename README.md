## Downfall

### Background 
Downfall's concept is based off of a sort of modified and reversed Doodle Jump. 
There will initially be a ball perpetually bouncing on a platform with approximatley 3-5 holes in it,
and it is the player's goal to drop the ball down the holes. They will earn point for doing so.
The challenge of the game is that the platform(s) will be comprised of 3 different colors. 
And the ball will be able to toggle between 2 different colors.One color will automatically 
end the game for the player if their ball lands on it. The player will have to toggle the 
ball's current color to match one of the other 2 color's before being able to safely land on that color.

### MVPs

- [ ] Start and reset game board
- [ ] Bouncing ball 
- [ ] Movable Platforms 
- [ ] Colors on platforms along with color toggle on ball 
- [ ] Points system based on the further your drop 
- [ ] Short styled description of game rules/controls displayed 
- [ ] A production README 

### Techonologies 

JavaScript for game logic,
React for creating components,
Canvas for rendering,
Webpack for bundle js files, 
CSS for styling 

Anticipated technical challenges- Fluid movement mechanics based on moving platform instead of ball
might prove to be a little difficult.
Implementing collision and bouncing/jumping systems could potentially be a bit tricky as well. 
 
### Wireframes 

This app will consist of a single page with the main game board along with short rules/description, and links. 
Game controls will include a start button which will start and restart the game. 

*wireframe pictures to be added* 

### Implementation Timeline 

**Day One**: Setup and game start along with implementing bouncing ball static platforms.
**Day Two**: Implement moving platforms and colors on them. Along with toggle on ball.
**Day Three**: Implement point system, and game reset along with displaying short rules/controls and 
writing production README. 

### Bonus Features

- [ ] Add rewards for consecutive falling through holes without touching any platform. 
- [ ] Add a high score tracker system
