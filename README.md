## Downfall

### Background
Downfall is a game that features dropping a bouncing ball downward until you hit the golden platform.
All the while trying to gain as many points as possible by free-falling, avoiding as many platforms as possible.
There will initially be a ball perpetually bouncing on a platform wit 3-5 holes in it,
and it is the player's goal to drop the ball down the holes. They will earn points for doing so.
